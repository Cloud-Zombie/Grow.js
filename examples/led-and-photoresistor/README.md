# Light and Light Sensor
### Getting started

Wire up your photo resistor and LED light like so:

This example uses [the Johnny-Five robotics library](http://johnny-five.io/), you need to make sure that your arduino is flashed with Standard Firmata. Instructions for doing so can be found [here](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/wiki/Getting-Started#trouble-shooting). Once that's done you're ready for the next step!

Install the johnny-five library with:

```bash
npm install johnny-five
```

You are now ready to run this example code:

```bash
node example.js
```
