# 10 design principles

Please make pull requests with suggestions on this document to help improve it.

1. Interoperability: we won't have a true Internet of Things until we have webstandards, but early implementations of things that could potentially become standardized. We want to work on developing a secure way to connect Grow-IoT devices to other apps.

2. Usability: IoT is powerful technology, but for it to really make a difference it needs to be so easy to setup your grandparents could eventually do it. 

3. Security: duh. Let's explore using blockchain at some point...

5. Offline ready: sometimes for whatever reason, we loose connections to things. We need to be able to handle that.a

4. Modularity: We build modules that can help improve user experience around IoT, and make it easy to follow secure practices. We should continually make an effort to break up our code base it useful modules.

5. Use existing good ideas: we don't need to reinvent the wheel, if there are good and usable libraries / projects that already exist, we should contribute to them.

6. Decentralization is good: we want to explore how we can use projects like Ethereum and IPFS to decentralize and create fair incentive structures.

7. Easy to setup your own instance: this is why we're using meteor, because all someone needs to do is spin up an instance on meteor.galaxy and wah-lah, they've got their own IoT network in the cloud. Allowing *you* ownership of your data.
